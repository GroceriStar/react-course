## Expected result

1.  Read this tutorial chapter
2.  follow code steps
3.  move your code to this repository(at least one commit per day)
4.  explain to me, what did you learn from it in a few sentences(not less than 5)
5.  pass the test section
6.  after reviewing your progress and closing this issue - you can move to the next chapter.

## Test
1.  similar component for day checker is month checker. Create it.
2.  btw, can you have a some sort of component between month and day - week, right?
with ability(method) - to grab only work days, and other method for weekends?
3.  separate some of repeating functionality from that HTML code too...
4.  I want to have one array - that will contain days and month together. so when you'll need to render a 'calendar' table - you'll use 2 forEach methods.
5.  and i want to have all static data - like titles, image url, content - into one file, make it like array. sample: https://github.com/ChickenKyiv/recipe-search-react/tree/master/src/data
