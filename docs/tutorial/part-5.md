## Expected result

1.  Read this tutorial chapter
2.  follow code steps
3.  move your code to this repository(at least one commit per day)
4.  explain to me, what did you learn from it in a few sentences(not less than 5)
5.  pass the test section
6.  after reviewing your progress and closing this issue - you can move to the next chapter.

as this chapter is more about understanding details - there no a coding test section

#### Question
what do you think, after reading this chapter - is state will replicate
partially a work of jquery things? i mean will state reduce amount of
jquery work?
