## Expected result

1.  Read this tutorial chapter
2.  follow code steps
3.  move your code to this repository(at least one commit per day)
4.  explain to me, what did you learn from it in a few sentences(not less than 5)
5.  pass the test section
6.  after reviewing your progress and closing this issue - you can move to the next chapter.

## Test
1.   Google and learn about constructor and super() function. Tell me what you've learned about it.
2.  With our extended form, I think this test wouldn't be a hard thing for you. So, create an array(at the separated file) with data, for a few meals. at least 3-4.
Then we'll create some sort of meals editing.
display meals at the list. and each meal should have an edit button(pass meal id there).
when a user clicks on edit button - you should display a form(it should be hidden before).
And by using knowledge of this chapter - fill form fields with values your meals array.
So you'll have one form, and each time, by picking an id - you'll grab one element from meals array - and display that data.
