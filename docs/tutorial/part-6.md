## Test
1.  extend meal component. we need to have image for each meal, also add this elements, like description(textarea), like steps(textarea). upload image is not necessary, we can use a free images from web, so we need to have input where we'll put open urls like: https://flic.kr/p/25zkvjU, https://flic.kr/p/25q8ngt, https://flic.kr/p/26MfbWD, https://flic.kr/p/8b21KZ
