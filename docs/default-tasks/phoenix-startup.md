## convert phoenix startup template into react page

#### Description/Steps to reproduce

Please check this code repo. https://github.com/atherdon/ph-st
It's a UI Kit, that was created by my friends, and they shared with me a free sample to try.
basic idea is to convert that HTML code into react page.
You should provide your step-by-step plan, where you'll explain
- **how you'll do it**.
- **What do you need from me**
- **What will be a problem and what questions do you have to me, before you'll start.**

for fast start we can use a template from `build` folder
But also check their src structure and tell me - will you be able to setup a local version of development version where we'll be able to alter scss?

compiled HTML are here: https://github.com/atherdon/ph-st/tree/master/build


checklist
as it's a big task, please tell me your step by step plan. 
it'll be cool to go from basic stuff first, like: 

- implement header and footer and container -->
- then go to each block -->
- and show me the progress each time when you finish the item

So I can review it, and make some corrections.

in order to be able to see the result online - we must push repository code on https://www.netlify.com/
when you create an account here and try to move this repo - you'll need to get a grant access from me.
Do it - I'll receive a notification and I'll approve it.
